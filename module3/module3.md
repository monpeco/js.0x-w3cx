### What you will learn in Module 3

Note that this module will be more "project oriented", i.e., we will introduce less "fundamental concepts".

JavaScript arrays and strings: in this module, we continue to study fundamental JavaScript concepts, and this time we look a bit deeper into JavaScript arrays and strings.
New HTML5 APIs - geolocation and video/audio APIs: in module 2, we looked at some HTML5 APIs already: the selector and the DOM APIs, respectively for selecting and manipulating HTML elements dynamically. We also had a taste of the HTML5 canvas API for drawing and animating. This time, we will look at the audio and video elements APIs, and the geolocation API.
We will also add background Music and sound effects to the small game we started writing during module 2.
