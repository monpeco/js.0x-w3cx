#Video introduction - Module 1

####Module 1: Introduction to JavaScript > 1.1 Introduction - Module 1 > Video introduction - Module 1

> Hello everyone, welcome to the wonderful world of JavaScript! In this
> module, after giving a brief history of JavaScript and Web browsers,
> we will explain how HTML, CSS and JavaScript are related to one
> another. We will see JavaScript in action through numerous interactive
> examples. We have made sure that all examples can be run directly in
> the course’s Web pages. Hey, we’re teaching Web technologies, after
> all! We will do that throughout the course, as you will be asked to
> change some code, tweak this or that example, even if the code details
> are not fully explained at first. Because, this is how we recommend
> beginners to learn JavaScript: first look at examples, then tweak some
> code and see the results of the changes. You will certainly encounter
> error messages, but no worries, as I will teach you how to debug
> JavaScript code using your browser’s devtool console. In this first
> module, you will also learn about JavaScript variables, operators and
> expressions, and have a first lesson about functions, objects, arrays
> and strings. These are the basic concepts of JavaScript and are shared
> by many other programming languages. We’ll then develop together, and
> step by step, an interactive graphic tool that will use many different
> features from JavaScript, HTML and CSS. Let’s start having fun with
> JavaScript, now :-)

###What you will learn in Module 1

If you thought that a Web browser could only display HTML documents, you were mistaken! ;)
Under the hood, an HTML document is nearly always associated with two other standard languages of the Web: CSS and JavaScript. Before looking at the guts of JavaScript, we will introduce you to the basics and play with many examples. We will also have a first look at the browser devtools, and discover how JavaScript is useful.

*  First we will briefly discuss the roles of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and how they work together.  
*  We will show examples of what can be done with JavaScript: a showcase of very small examples through to impressively complex ones.  
*  Then we will look at a dozen different - very small - examples of typical uses of JavaScript. This time, we will explain the examples :-)  
*  Finally we will learn how to use the browser devtools, a powerful, built-in set of tools that represent the Swiss army knife of any Web developer. Without the devtools, you will not be able to debug your code, find errors, print traces of what a JavaScript program is doing etc.  
 

*A word of caution*: you will not learn JavaScript in full detail in this course! This is an introductory course designed to help you understand the basic concepts of the language.
